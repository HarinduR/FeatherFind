Step 1: Prepare the Dataset

	Collect Data: Start with your existing dataset of bird descriptions and features.

	Generate Synthetic Data: Use a rule-based system to create additional examples (e.g., 500+ samples).

	Balance the Dataset: Ensure all features (e.g., size, color, habitat) are well-represented.


Step 2: Preprocess the Data

	Text Preprocessing:

		Tokenize the text (e.g., split into words).

		Remove stopwords, punctuation, and irrelevant terms.

	TF-IDF Vectorization:

		Convert text descriptions into numerical vectors.

		Fit the vectorizer on the training set only to prevent data leakage.

	Label Preprocessing:

		Flatten nested feature dictionaries into a list of strings (e.g., ["size=small", "color_primary=blue"]).

		Use MultiLabelBinarizer to convert these lists into binary vectors.

		Fit the binarizer on the training set only.


Step 3: Split the Data

	Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

	Ensure the split is stratified to maintain the distribution of features.


Step 4: Build the Model
	
	Model Architecture:

		Use a simple feedforward neural network with 1-2 hidden layers.

		Output layer: Sigmoid activation (for multi-label classification).

		Loss Function: Binary cross-entropy (since each output neuron is independent).

		Optimizer: Adam (efficient and widely used).

		Regularization: Add dropout to prevent overfitting.


Step 5: Train the Model

	Train the model on the training set.

	Use class weights to handle imbalanced labels.

	Monitor training and validation loss/accuracy to detect overfitting.


Step 6: Evaluate the Model
	
	Evaluate the model on the testing set.

	Generate a classification report (precision, recall, F1-score) for each feature.

	Plot training vs validation metrics (accuracy, loss).
	

Step 7: Deploy the Model
	
	Save the trained model, vectorizer, and binarizer.

	Create a Flask API to serve predictions.

	Test the API with new bird descriptions.
	

Step 8: Improve the Model (Optional)
	
	Add More Data: Generate more synthetic examples or collect real-world data.

	Tune Hyperparameters: Use Grid Search or Randomized Search.

	Use Advanced Techniques: Replace TF-IDF with word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT).
