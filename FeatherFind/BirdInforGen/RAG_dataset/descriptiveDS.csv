Name,Scientific Name,Description
Red-vented Bulbul,Pycnonotus cafer,"A dark, sleek, medium-sized bird with a black crest and a white rump. The red color under the tail is often difficult to see. Eats fruit, flower buds, and insects. Conspicuous and sometimes gregarious, often seen high in trees or perched on wires in urban and rural areas; generally prefers scrubby edge habitat instead of dense forest. Calls include a variety of chirps and whistles. Native to South and Southeast Asia. Introduced to Kuwait, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Oman, and some Polynesian islands, including Hawaii."
Blue-tailed Bee-eater,Merops philippinus,"Elegant, slender bird of open country, frequently seen in flight or perched on exposed snags or telephone wires. Adult green overall, with blue tail, thin black mask, and rufous throat; bright rufous underwings visible in flight. Juvenile similar but paler, with tannish throat and shorter tail, lacking the adult's elongated central tail feathers. Flying bird has distinctive shape, with broad, sharply pointed wings, long tail, and long bill. Nests colonially in sandbanks. Voice a sweet, clipped “cheer-it,” sometimes given in series."
White-throated Kingfisher,Halcyon smyrnensis,"Large-headed, predominantly brown kingfisher with electric-blue back and wings, heavy red bill, and snow-white patch from the throat through the breast. Common both near and away from water; frequently seen perched on fence posts and telephone lines near wetlands, lakes, agricultural fields, and clearings. Gives jarring, raptor-like descending trills and cackles, often in flight."
Gray-headed Swamphen,Porphyrio poliocephalus,"A very large bluish-purple waterbird with a red bill and forehead shield, as well as red legs and feet with long toes. The tail is flicked up often, revealing fluffy white “underpants.” Juveniles are duller than adults and lack the red bill and shield. An inhabitant of marshy, vegetated freshwater bodies such as swamps, rivers, and lakes; usually in small groups. Feeds, often clumsily, at muddy water edges, in reeds, and on floating vegetation. Makes short nasal grunts and croaking sounds. Formerly part of the species known as Purple Swamphen."
White-breasted Waterhen,Amaurornis phoenicurus,"Medium-sized, fairly common chickenlike marsh bird found in meadows, ditches, riversides, marshes, as well as parks and farmlands in close proximity to humans; often seen foraging in the open. Adults are dark slaty above and white below, with a rusty patch under the tail. Juvenile similar but duller in color. Remarkably variable song is a series of hooting, grunting, or rasping notes or phrases, repeated monotonously, often from an exposed perch."
Red-wattled Lapwing,Vanellus indicus,"A distinctly marked lapwing with a black breast and throat and a red bill with a black tip. It also sports red wattles in front of the eyes and a white patch that runs down the cheeks to the underparts. In flight, note the black flight feathers that contrast with the white wing patch. Usually found in small groups around water bodies, agricultural fields, and dry land. They feed primarily on insects, catching them in a typical plover like manner, running a short distance and picking up food from ground. A bird known for its characteristics loud alarm call, often compared to the words “Did we do it?”"
Little Cormorant,Microcarbo niger,"An all black ducklike waterbird with a distinctive flattish head and a bill that is sharply hooked at the tip. Smallest of the cormorants found in the region. Breeding adults have white plumes on the sides of the head. Like all cormorants, frequently seen swimming with its body low in the water, head and neck pointing upward, and suddenly disappearing underwater to catch fish. Often perches upright on a rock, drying itself with outstretched wings. Seen singly or in small groups in inland water bodies. Similar to Indian Cormorant, but note smaller size, stouter bill, and shape of the head, flat on Little Cormorant and rounded on Indian Cormorant."
Black-headed Ibis,Threskiornis melanocephalus,"A large wader with a white body and bare black head and neck. Males and females look similar and both have grayish tail feathers. It probes into mud and shallow water with its long, down curved black bill, sometimes submerging its entire head. Found primarily around wetlands including agricultural fields and occasionally around coastal areas, but also seen foraging in dry fields and human-modified landscapes."
Indian Pond-Heron,Ardeola grayii,"A small heron that is common in most aquatic habitats across the Indian subcontinent. Adults in breeding plumage have a dark reddish brown back that contrasts with a yellowish head, neck, and breast. In nonbreeding plumage they are virtually indistinguishable from nonbreeding Chinese Pond-Heron. In flight, adults appear surprisingly white due to their strikingly white wings, underparts, and tail. Although typically solitary, large numbers often gather where food is plentiful. Prone to seasonally local movements and vagrancy."
Little Egret,Egretta garzetta,"Small snow-white heron with slender dark bill, blackish legs, and yellowish feet (""golden slippers""). Breeding adult has 2 long wispy head plumes and a spray of white plumes (""aigrettes"") on the lower back. Inhabits a wide variety of wetlands: lakes, rivers, marshes, estuaries—almost anywhere with small fish. Occurs as singles or small loose groups; nests and roosts communally. Distinctive within its range, but compare with larger Great and Intermediate Egrets, stockier Cattle Egret, and white morph reef herons."
Purple Heron,Ardea purpurea,"Large heron with rusty head and streaky neck; juvenile is extensively rusty brown on upperparts. Favors fresh marshes with tall reeds and other vegetation. Often more retiring than Gray Heron and rarely seen in open situations. Only likely to be confused with larger and bulkier Gray Heron, which is paler and grayer overall, with a stouter bill."
Brahminy Kite,Haliastur indus,"A medium-sized raptor with a rounded tail unlike other kites. Adults are unmistakable with a white head and breast contrasting with otherwise brick brown plumage. Juveniles are a darker brownish-black with a paler head and prominent white patches under the wings. Usually associated with both inland and coastal wetlands in tropical Asia, but it is largely restricted to coastal wetlands in Australia where it is alternately known as “Red-backed Sea Eagle.” Call is a distinctive nasal, drawn out, “Kyeeerrh.”"
Rose-ringed Parakeet,Psittacula krameri,"Vibrantly bright green parakeet, frequently found in woodland, parks, and gardens, where it feeds mainly in trees. Nests in cavities, including holes in buildings. Easily overlooked if quiet, as the bright green plumage blends easily with foliage. Note the very long slender tail and bright red bill; male has narrow black-and-pink neck ring. Closely resembles the larger Alexandrine Parakeet, which has a wine-red patch on each shoulder. Like other parakeets, raucous and social, often appearing in noisy groups giving sharp screeching calls. Native to Africa and South Asia, introduced locally around the world, from Europe and the Caribbean to Japan and Hawaii."
Brown-headed Barbet,Psilopogon zeylanicus,"A green and brown barbet with prominent pale streaks on its brown head and breast. The brown throat and green wings with white speckling on the shoulders are characteristic of this species. Also note the large area of dull yellow facial skin and the brown-yellow bill that both turn orange-red when breeding. Immature is similar but duller. Heard more often than seen. Several calls exist, but the most common call is similar to the White-cheeked Barbet’s “kutrook-kutrook-kutrook,” but it is more mellow, sonorous, and less sharp sounding. Generally prefers drier woodlands compared to White-cheeked Barbet though they co-occur in many localities."
Spotted Dove,Spilopelia chinensis,"A common garden bird throughout much of Asia, found in open forests, fields, and parks; introduced to several regions around the world. Often tame and approachable. Brown overall with a rosy breast and a unique white-spotted black nape patch. Plumage shows slight regional variation: western birds have dark centers to wing feathers, lacking in eastern birds. Turtle-doves are larger, have black centers to wing feathers and stripes rather than spots on the neck. Coos loudly and often: “coo-a-roooo”."
Asian Koel,Eudynamys scolopaceus,"A large cuckoo, distinctive in all plumages, but usually secretive, keeping to the interior of dense trees in many habitats, even inner cities and fields. Adult males glossy black with dull lime-green bill; females and immatures blackish brown with white dots on the wings and strong streaking on head and throat. Adults have ruby-red eyes. Females lay eggs in the nests of other large birds, including crows, shrikes, and starlings. Song is a loud, persistent “ko-EL!” similar to a peacock’s call."
Common Tailorbird,Orthotomus sutorius,"A common warblerlike bird with a green back, a reddish crown, and a long bill. It gets its name from the way in which it builds its nest by stitching leaves together. A ubiquitous inhabitant of parks, gardens, and wooded areas across South and Southeast Asia. Its loud “tuui-tuui…” and “whee-whee…” calls are often part of the sound of daily life in human habitation. Co-occurs with the very similar Dark-necked Tailorbird in NE India and SE Asia, but is separable by call, and by the lack of a rufous hind-crown, and yellow vent."
Yellow-billed Babbler,Argya affinis,"A gregarious and noisy species endemic to southern India and Sri Lanka. Very similar to Jungle Babbler, with which it is often confused. On Yellow-billed Babbler, note the pale spot in front of the eyes and a pale crown that contrast with the dark throat and cheeks, giving it a pale capped and blank-faced appearance. Also note pale blue eyes and a pale base to the tail. Prefers drier habitats than the Jungle Babbler, though they can sometimes be seen in the same vicinity."
White-bellied Drongo,Dicrurus caerulescens,"A small drongo with a dull-black back and a relatively short, distinctively forked tail. The “white-bellied” form has an extensively white belly diffusely demarcated from the dark gray throat and breast. The “white-vented” from is restricted to Sri Lanka and is darker overall, with dark gray underparts and a white vent. The species is similar to juvenile Black and Ashy Drongos, which are larger and have smaller amounts of white, diffused with a dusky color or scaling, on the belly and vent. White-bellied is found in dry and open forests across the Indian subcontinent."
Black-hooded Oriole,Oriolus xanthornus,"A distinctive medium-sized yellow bird with a black head and breast, black flight feathers, and a red bill. In flight, the black band towards the tail tip is visible. Juvenile is duller overall with a white streaked throat and a darker bill. Often feeds on fruiting trees with a preference for figs in wooded gardens, groves, and open forests. The song is rich, fluty, and mellow. Calls include raspy, nasal notes that can sound like a croak."
Pied Kingfisher,Ceryle rudis,"Boldly marked black-and-white kingfisher with short, bushy crest and glossy all-dark bill. Superficially similar to Crested Kingfisher, but smaller, with a much more distinctly patterned head and breast and less erect crest. Frequently seen perched in pairs or small groups. Often hovers over water when seeking prey. Inhabits a wide range of waterside habitats, from lakes to estuaries to mangroves. Gives a variety of sharp notes, as well as dry trilling and rattling calls."
Greater Coucal,Centropus sinensis,"A large bird that resembles a cross between a crow and a pheasant. Largely black with distinctive rusty wings, glossy underparts, a long and heavy black tail, and deep red eyes. Juveniles are much duller with white bars on the tail and underparts and variable amounts of black streaks on the wings and upperparts. Common across a range of habitats except very dense forests. Similar to Lesser Coucal, but Greater Coucal is larger with a longer bill and red eyes. Adult Greater Coucals also lack the white streaks on the wings seen on Lesser Coucal. The call is a series of deep, resonant “oop-oop-oop” notes."
Rock Pigeon,Columba livia,"Fairly large pigeon with wild and feral populations throughout the world. True wild birds nest on cliffs and in caves from western Europe to central Asia. Pale gray overall with two bold black wingbars and iridescent purple and green on neck. Feral varieties are common in cities and farmland, often in large flocks. Variable plumage: some identical to wild-type birds, but can be completely black, white, or orangey-brown and any combination in between."
Lesser Whistling-Duck,Dendrocygna javanica,"A small, well-proportioned, tree-nesting duck. Pale brown overall with a darker brown crown and nape, warmer chestnut underparts, and chestnut-fringed feathers on the back. Note the faint orange-yellow eyering and the dark gray bill and legs. Sexes similar; juveniles duller. A gregarious duck found in shallow water bodies with abundant vegetation. Flies with rapid wingbeats on broad dark wings; note flashing chestnut shoulders and chestnut rump. Call is a wheezy whistling “seasick-seasick."""
Asian Palm Swift,Cypsiurus balasiensis,"A small gray-brown swift with long thin wings and a long heavily-forked tail. Darker above and paler below. Can be seen in rapid fluttering flight, often making trilling “tiririree” calls while foraging on insects in pairs or loose flocks. Mostly seen over open areas such as fields and agricultural land, but partial to areas with palms on which they breed."
